ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Liza!

As a passionate backend developer with over five years of experience, I am always eager to learn and explore new technologies. My GitHub repository serves as an archive of my diverse projects. Here, you'll find everything from experimental and study-based projects to comprehensive guides on the tools I use.

I particularly enjoy working with Go due to its simplicity!

ðŸ“š Currently, I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Computational Biomedical Engineering at the University of Pompeu Fabra, which also influences some of the projects you'll see here.
